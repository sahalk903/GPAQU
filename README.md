This program is a GPA calculator for Quinnipiac students. It takes the users name, major, classes, credits for those classes, and grades in those classes. With al this information it calculates the students currented weighted GPA on a 4.0 scale. All of this information is stored in a file with the name of their choosing. These files can then be accessed later to see what progression is made or the files can be overwritten if the same name is used for the file. This is useful for Quinnipiac students to be able to know their GPA throughout the semester rather than just at the end. Enjoy!
